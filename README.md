CashWeb messaging system is a highly scalable federated messaging system that
uses cryptocurrency commitments to automate moderation. This avoids the need for
complicated moderation systems to inhibit SPAM. This also obviates the need for
centralized servers. As a consequence of this, CashWeb messages are
uncensorable.
