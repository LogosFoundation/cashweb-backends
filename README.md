# Cash:web Library

`cashweb` is a collection of useful components, built ontop of the [Tower](https://github.com/tower-rs/tower) library, designed for quick integration of the [POP token protocol](https://github.com/cashweb/specifications/blob/doc/bip70-token-protocol/proof-of-payment-token/specification.mediawiki#cite_ref-1-0) into Rust services.

The aim of this library is to provide a framework were everything unspecified in the protocol is generic and everything specified in the protocol is automatically implemented.

### What is Tower?

> Tower is a library of modular and reusable components for building robust networking clients and servers.

## Usage

Add this to your `cargo.toml`

```toml
tower-pop-token = "0.1"
```

The current version requires Rust 1.39 or later.
